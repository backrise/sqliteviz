# Multiple CSV, JSON or NDJSON file import

Sometimes it's useful to import several files as tables in one database. For
example, to be able to `JOIN` them in SQL.

In sqliteviz you can not only create a database from a CSV, JSON or NDJSON file, but also add
another table from CSV, JSON or NDJSON to the existing database.
